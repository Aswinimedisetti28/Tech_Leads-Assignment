        "In Python, conditions are used to make decisions in your code. You can control the flow of your program based on whether certain conditions are true or false. The primary way to implement conditions is through `if`, `elif`, and `else` , 'nested if' statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how you can use conditions in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **if Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "**SYNTAX:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   if condition:\n",
        "       # code to be executed if the condition is true\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example:**\n",

        "   if age >= 18:\n",
        "       print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **if-else Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The `if-else` statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **SYNTAX:**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **if-elif-else Statement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The `if-elif-else` statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the first condition that is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **SYNTAX:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   if condition1:\n",
        "       # code to be executed if condition1 is true\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 5\n",
        "y = 10\n",
        "\n",
        "if x > 0 and y > 0:\n",
        "    print(\"Both x and y are positive.\")\n",
        "elif x > 0 or y > 0:\n",
        "    print(\"At least one of x or y is positive.\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"Neither x nor y is positive.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Output:**\n",
        "Both x and y are positive.\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **nested if:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditions are essential for controlling the flow of your program and making decisions based on different situations. They allow you to create more dynamic and responsive code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you can use nested `if` statements to create multiple levels of conditions within each other. This allows you to check for more complex combinations of conditions and execute different code blocks accordingly. Here's how you can use nested `if` statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "**SYNTAX:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition1:\n",
        "    # code to be executed if condition1 is true\n",
        "    if condition2:\n",
        "        # code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are true\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        # code to be executed if condition1 is true but condition2 is false\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    # code to be executed if condition1 is false\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of a nested `if` statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "age = 25\n",
        "if age >= 18:\n",
        "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
        "    if age >= 21:\n",
        "        print(\"You can legally drink alcohol.\")\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        print(\"You cannot legally drink alcohol.\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"You are not an adult.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the outer `if` statement checks whether `age` is greater than or equal to 18. If this condition is true, it enters the inner `if` statement to further check whether `age` is greater than or equal to 21. Depending on the values of `age`, different messages are printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to format your nested `if` statements properly to maintain readability. You can use consistent indentation to show the levels of nesting and make your code easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. LISTS IN PYTHON:\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, a list is a versatile and commonly used data structure that allows you to store a collection of items. Lists are ordered and mutable, which means you can change, add, or remove items after the list is created. Here's how you work with lists in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Creating Lists:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   You can create a list by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of values in square brackets `[ ]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "   words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "   mixed = [10, \"hello\", True]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Accessing Elements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   You can access individual elements in a list by using their index. Remember that indexing in Python is zero-based.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "   print(my_list[0])  # Outputs: 1\n",
        "   print(my_list[2])  # Outputs: 3\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Slicing Lists:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   You can extract a subset of a list using slicing. Slicing allows you to specify a start index, end index, and an optional step size.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "   subset = my_list[1:4]  # Outputs: [2, 3, 4]\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Modifying Lists:**\n",
        "   Lists are mutable, so you can change their elements by assigning new values to specific indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "   my_list[2] = 10\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Adding and Removing Elements:**\n",
        "   You can add elements to the end of a list using the `append()` method, and you can remove elements using methods like `remove()` and `pop()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   my_list.append(4)     \n",
        "   my_list.remove(2)      \n",
        "   popped_element = my_list.pop()  \n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **List Methods:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Python provides several methods for manipulating lists, such as `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\n",
        "   my_list.sort()\n",
        "   my_list.reverse()\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **List Comprehensions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 6)]  #\n",
        "   ```\n",

        "\n",
        "Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of your program. It helps prevent crashes and unexpected behavior by providing a way to catch and respond to specific types of errors. The `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements are used for exception handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how you can use exception handling in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **try-except:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception. The `except` block specifies the actions to be taken if a specific exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**syntax:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       # code that may raise an exception\n",
        "   except SomeExceptionType:\n",
        "       # code to handle the exception\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "       result = 10 / num\n",
        "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
        "   except ValueError:\n",
        "       print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **else:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. It's typically used to handle code that should run only when no exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "**syntax:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       # code that may raise an exception\n",
        "   except SomeExceptionType:\n",
        "       # code to handle the exception\n",
        "   else:\n",
        "       # code to run when no exception occurs\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
        "       result = 10 / num\n",
        "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
        "   else:\n",
        "       print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **finally:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   The `finally` block is used to execute cleanup code, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. It is often used for releasing resources or closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **syntax:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       # code that may raise an exception\n",
        "   except SomeExceptionType:\n",
        "       # code to handle the exception\n",
        "   finally:\n",
        "       # cleanup code that always runs\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   file = None\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
        "       content = file.read()\n",
        "   except FileNotFoundError:\n",
        "       print(\"File not found\")\n",
        "   finally:\n",
        "       if file:\n",
        "           file.close()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Raising Exceptions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   You can raise your own exceptions using the `raise` statement. This is useful when you want to signal an error condition in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   if x < 0:\n",
        "       raise ValueError(\"x should be a positive number\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling helps you write more robust code that gracefully handles errors and prevents unexpected crashes.\n",
