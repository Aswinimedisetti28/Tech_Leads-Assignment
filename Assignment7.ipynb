        "- Exception handling is a crucial aspect of programming that allows you to manage and gracefully recover from errors or exceptional situations that might occur during the execution of your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python,  like many other programming languages, provide a robust mechanism for handling exceptions, ensuring that your programs don't crash abruptly when unexpected issues arise.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In python, exceptions are objects that represent errors or exceptional events that disrupt the normal flow of program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- These exceptions can be caused by various factors, such as invalid input, file not found, network issues , and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exception handling weenables you to catch these exceptions, handle them appropriately, and continue executng the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic structure of exception handling in python involves three main components:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. try:** This block contains the code that might raise an exception. it is used to isolate the potentially problematic code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. except:** If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the code inside the associated `except` potentially problematic code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. finally:** This optional block is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's often used for cleanup operations , such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
